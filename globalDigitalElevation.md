# Global Digital Elevation Models
The purpose of the project is to learn how to find and download elevation models for developing countries and how to derive a variety of
terrain products from those models using SAGA. SAG is an open-source desktop GIS developed by German physical geographers and contains an
excellent suite of raster analysis tools. 

The goal is to get the channel network of the Mt. Kilimanjaro in northern Tanzania.

## Data Collection
Either data can be used for the lab:
- ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model, distribute by NASA EOSDIS Land Processes DAAC.
- NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Global 1 arc second. 2013, distributed by NASA EOSDIS Land Processes DAAC.
I have decided to use the SRTM Global Digital Elevation Model.
The data is dowloaded from [earth data](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/).
