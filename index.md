# Open source GIS 

## Article Review
### [FOSS4 Conference 2018 article review](articles/literature_review.md)
Here is my review of an article that uses opensource GIS analysis tools.

### [Using Face Recognition with Twitter Data for the Study of International Migration](articles/twitter_article.md)
Here is my review of a paper that uses twitter data for geographical analysis.

## [Activity 1](projects/qgisModel.md): QGIS Modeling
I created a model to calculate the direction and distance from a point in QGIS. With the model, I downloaded data from Puerto Rico and did an analysis using the model that I made.

## Activity 2: Hydrology using SAGA
### [Phase 1](projects/globalDigitalElevation.md): Global Digital Elevation Models of Mt. Kilimanjaro
I used SAGA software to derive the channel networks of the Mt. Kilimanjaro region using SRTM data. 

### [Phase 2](projects/ModelErrorPropagation.md): Global Digital Elevation Models (Automation, Error Propogation and Uncertainty) of Bali and Lombok
I used batch processing algorithms for SAGA tools to automate the processing tasks to calculate the channel networks of Bali and Lombok Islands, Indonesia, with a focus in understanding sources of errors and comparing elevation models and their resulting hydrological models from two different data sources (Aster and SRTM).

## [Activity 3](projects/DarAnalysis.md): SQL and OSM for Urban Resilience
I used data from OpenStreetMap and Resilience Academy to understand urban resilience in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Specifically, I looked at the hotel distribution in Dar es Salaam's subwards, and the number of restaurants that are within 500 meters from each hotel. I implemented my solution in PostGIS in QGIS.

## [Activity 4](projects/malawi_analysis.md): Multi-Criteria analysis of the vulnerability of Malawi
I tried to replicate the analysis of Malawi vulnerability of Malcomb et al.(2014)'s paper and critically understand the reproducibility and uncertainty of his approach. 

## [Activity 5](projects/twitter_analysis.md):Sharpie versus Storm Surge in the Twittersphere of Hurricane Dorian
I conducted an analysis of the twitter activity during Hurrican Dorian to identify and map potential geographic clustering and hotspots of Twitter activity and think about whether the real hurricane path or President Trump's fake sharpie maps had driven more Twitter activity.
