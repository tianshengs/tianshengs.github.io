# Open source GIS 
### FOSS4 Conference 2018 article review
Here is my review of an article that uses opensource GIS analysis tools.

## [Activity 1](qgisModel.md): QGIS Modeling
I created a model to calculate the direction and distance from a point in QGIS. With the model, I downloaded data from Puerto Rico and did an analysis using the model that I made. Click to learn more. 

## Activity 2
### [Phase 1](globalDigitalElevation.md): Global Digital Elevation Models
I used SAGA software to derive the channel networks of the Mt. Kilimanjaro region using SRTM data. 

### [Phase 2](ModelErrorPropagation.md): Global Digital Elevation Models (Automation, Error Propogation and Uncertainty)
I used batch processing algorithms for SAGA tools to automate the processing tasks to calculate the channel networks of Bali and Lombok Islands, Indonesia, with a focus in understanding sources of errors and comparing elevation models and their resulting hydrological models from two different data sources (Aster and SRTM).

## [Activity 3](DarAnalysis.md)
I used data from OpenStreetMap and Resilience Academy to understand urban resilience in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Specifically, I looked at the hotel distribution in Dar es Salaam's subwards, and the number of restaurants that are within 500 meters from each hotel. I implemented my solution in PostGIS in QGIS.
